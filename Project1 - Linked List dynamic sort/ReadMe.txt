	It is the requirement of this assignment that you have to use linked list data structure and
dynamic memory allocation. You are not allowed to build the list first and then sort it with
a separate sorting algorithm. Instead, you should build the linked list in the specified sorted
order while inserting the elements. Once the linked list is built, you are not allowed to make any
additional passes on the linked list except for printing it. Also, you cannot assume maximum
number of characters for the strings (FirstName and LastName); they can be any size and the
memory for them should be created dynamically. This will allow you to practice with malloc,
pointers and structures.
You will develop your program in a Unix environment using the C programming language. You
can develop your program using a text editor (emacs, vi, gedit etc.). You will be provided a Makefile
and your program should compile without any errors/warnings using this Makefile. Black-box testing
will be applied and your programâ€™s output will be compared to the correct output. A simple black-box
testing script will be provided to you for your own test; make sure that your program produces
the success message in the provided test.
